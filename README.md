# archetipicoBot

This bot <strike>does</strike> did some things -> <a href="https://t.me//archetipicoBot">bot</a>

The bot has been shut down since I'm rewriting it from scratch using Telegram Python API.
The code will remain here since it could be useful for someone.

<i>Why are you archiving and changing the repo instead of just overwriting everything in this repository to keep commits?</i>

Because this bot uses different API keys, because the project is entirely modified and because the features won't be exactly the same, thus I see fit to create a complete different project.
